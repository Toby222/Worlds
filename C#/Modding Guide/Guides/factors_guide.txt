---- Factors Guide ----

Factors are properties that can be used to modify other properties like, for example, and event time-to-trigger. Note that factors will always have values between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

- Factor operators -

[SQ] - SQUARE: A factor's effect can squared (i.e. multiply the factor by itself) before being applied to the affected property by using the [SQ] prefix.

[INV] - INVERSE: A factor's effect can be inversed by applying the [INV] prefix so that the affected property becomes inversely proportional (i.e. '[INV]<factor>' equals '1 - <factor>').


Operators must be enclosed together with factors within single quotes. Modifiers can be used together using parenthesis to set modifier priority (values between parenthesis evaluate first).
Example: '[SQ]([INV]<factor>)'

Here's a list of the current types of factors (more to be added in future versions) and how they work:

- 'cell_accessibility'
    Returns the accessibility (i.e. how accessible the terrain is) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_accessibility', '[INV]cell_accessibility'

- 'cell_arability'
    Returns the arability (i.e. how arable the land is) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_arability', '[INV]cell_arability'

- 'cell_foraging_capacity'
    Returns the foraging capacity (i.e. how many resources can be extracted through foraging) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_foraging_capacity', '[INV]cell_foraging_capacity'

- 'cell_survivability'
    Returns the survivability (i.e. how easy is for humans to survive on that cell) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_survivability', '[INV]cell_survivability'

- 'cell_hilliness'
    Returns the hilliness (i.e. how hilly the terrain is) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_hilliness', '[INV]cell_hilliness'

- 'cell_flowing_water'
    Returns the amount of flowing water on the terrain cell, divided by the 'max_flowing_water' parameter (a value between 10 and 100000), as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_flowing_water:2000', '[INV]cell_flowing_water:5000'

- 'cell_biome_presence'
    Returns the presence of a particular biome (i.e. percentage of area in cell covered by such biome) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_biome_presence:forest', '[INV]cell_biome_presence:desert'

- 'cell_biome_type_presence'
    Returns the presence of a particular biome type (i.e. percentage of area in cell covered by biomes of said type) of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_biome_type_presence:water', '[INV]cell_biome_type_presence:land'

- 'neighborhood_biome_type_presence'
    Calculates the total amount of biomes of a particular type present in the target cell and all neighboring cells surrounding the cell. The factor's value will fall within the range of 0 (no type presence in the target cell nor any surrounding cell) and 1 (all 9 cells have 100% biome presence of type)

    Examples: 'neighborhood_biome_type_presence:water', '[INV]neighborhood_biome_type_presence:ice'

- 'cell_biome_trait_presence'
    Returns the presence of a particular biome trait (ie. 'wood', 'sea') of the terrain cell as a value between 0 and 1

    Examples: 'cell_biome_trait_presence:sea', '[INV]cell_biome_trait_presence:wood'

- 'neighborhood_biome_trait_presence'
    Calculates the total presence of a particular biome trait in the target cell and all neighboring cells surrounding the cell. The factor's value will fall within the range of 0 (no trait presence in the target cell nor any surrounding cell) and 1 (all 9 cells have 100% biome presence of trait)

    Examples: 'neighborhood_biome_trait_presence:sea', '[INV]neighborhood_biome_trait_presence:wood'

---- Discovery Modding Guide ----

Discovery modding files are located within the 'Discoveries' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

-- File Structure --

{
  "discoveries": [ -- list of discoveries --
    {
      "id":                         -- (required) Unique discovery identifier, if more than one definition share ids, only the last one loaded will be used
      "name":                       -- (required) Name of discovery

      "gainConditions":             -- (optional) List of all conditions a cell group must meet to gain this discovery, separated by commas (see note #2)
      "holdConditions":             -- (optional) List of all conditions a cell group must meet to hold onto this discovery, separated by commas (see note #2 and note #4)

      "gainEffects":                -- (optional) List of all effects triggered on cell group upon gaining this discovery (see note #3)
      "lossEffects":                -- (optional) List of all effects triggered on cell group upon losing this discovery (see note #3)

      "eventTimeToTrigger":         -- (required) The base maximum amount of time that can pass before the related discovery event happens (value between 1 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 days).
      "eventTimeToTriggerFactors":  -- (optional) List of factors that influence how long it will take for this discovery's event to trigger (see note #5)
    },
    ... -- additional discoveries --
  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
2. Refer to conditions_guide.txt for more details on how to define and use conditions
3. Refer to effects_guide.txt for more details on how to define and use effects
4. If a discovery no longer meets its hold conditions then it will be removed from the cell group. In which case, the gain conditions might get reevaluated and a subsequent discovery event reassigned to the group if possible
5. Factors, once calculated, will be multiplied against the time-to-trigger base value of a discovery to calculate that maximum amount of time that can pass between the inception of an event and when it finally triggers. If a factor is zero, the time-to-trigger will be set to a minimum value (e.g. 1 day). Refer to factors_guide.txt for more details on how to define and use factors.
